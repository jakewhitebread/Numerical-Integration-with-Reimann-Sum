# Numerical-Integration-with-Reimann-Sum
A program for my Modeling and Simulation Class that models the Reimann Sum of a given ODE.

# Instructions:
You are going to need a properly running computer with at least 8GB of Ram. 
Installs of Required Software/Libraries: SciPy, NumPy, Matplotlib, and mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.

Inside the .zip file, you will find a folder labeled project5. Open this folder and then open the folder Jwhitebread_project5.
Inside that folder you should find the Jwhitebread_project5.py file.

To run the program, simply copy and paste the code from my Jwhitebread_project5.py file into a new pycharm python project and then press run. 

There will be a series of graphs that pop up. When done with each graph simply press the x in the corner to get to the next.
